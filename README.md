# LearningHTML.github.io
A Website to Learn about HTML with inline CSS

UNDER CONSTRUCTION: website to be rewritten with notes in HTML Body 
- Done: Index Page
- 
- NOTE: Questions on each lesson enable students to develop own understanding of lesson and how to 
- SITE Map: review site map first as a prep lesson, must know how website will be expereinced before building
- ChildPage: HEAD, BODY Semantic Tags (images, definitions of section and article through concept sets)
- MetaData: defaults & what to change, way to add an image needs to be explored
- Footer Page: Website-level Footer (blockquote, citing, date, hyperlink & forced naviation (with alternatives), strong, em, cascading)
- Index.HTML NAV: ul or ol with inline attributes applied to all below
- Sub & Superscript with paragraph: simplare p-tag in aside with default attributes, "where do you set these", only controlled locally
- H1 to H6 compared to paragraph tag: differnet sizes in Aside
- H1 to H6 in different sematic tags
- H1 in Cascading
- H1 to H6, p, & a in vw units with research to styles like centering text
- Image Lesson: focusing on display-window changing with percent, issue of memory with website resources ("on which server are these saved")
- DIVs: using a HTML-DIV vs. style border in semantic tags as a wild card (to introduce flexbox)
- Flexbox: minimum CSS, issues with spacing, viewing borders or where DIVs are, creating HTML style references, creating classes, combining classes, leading to style.css as minimum then rewriting with page level styles, then inline styles (i.e. wild card will get the VW units to be rewritten in-line
- 
- Additional Lessons Examples, not taught but code explored
- 
- Student Grade increases if HTML of each page changes
- Student grade increases when summary changes to each students voice

Grading ... (remember minimum expectation is inline CSS, additional option inline JavaScript)
- Minimum Expectations of Each Page: https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Introductory-HTML#html-with-inline-css-boilerplate-checklist-and-template-creation
- Full Summary Expectation: https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Introductory-HTML/blob/main/HTML_Summary.txt

Mr. Mercer's Teaching Exemplar: https://qehs-websites.github.io/LearningHTML.github.io/
- Also see: https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/LearningHTML.github.io
- Must have all pages (your version and your creativity) in Organized List

Progressions (See GitHub for Full Explanation)
- Choose between locally hosted and public facing repository (.github.io)
- If Public-facing, activate GitHub Pages
- Create Repository and Project Folder with Basic Website Folder-Organization and Files
- Annotating ReadMe.md Files with GitHub Markdown (starting in Other End-unit projects)
- Text Data, <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/LearningHTML.github.io#text-data">Click Here to jump below</a>

Using https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Introductory-HTML
- Create index.html & boilerplate
- Create Template.html with Footer Quote
- Modify index.html to match website page structure, responsive design, and Flexbox for Sematic HTML Tags
- Copy and rename childPages Template.html as needed for experimental pages
- Create Hyperlinks from index.html and test links to experimental pages
- Link any additional pages you have created in childPages

Pages you should have:
- Index page (with Responsive Design, Hyperlinks, and Flexbox)

Building a Webpage to Learning about Building

### Date Started
20201118 | November 18, 2020

### Author
Mark Mercer

### 50-word Description of the Website
This website is used to demonstrate how to build a webpage, and then how to build a website using only HTML and a little inline CSS. Emphasized will be hyperlinks, HTML Tags for formatting, Images, Video links to YouTube and other media files, and some enrichment. We will create a template file for additional child pages to illustrate more information.

- [] Mandatory Hyperlinks: Image Lesson (2 images sized differently), Index Page with Flexbox
- [] Optional: Experimental Pages

#### Atom

Completing the Different Experimental Pages to understand HTML & inline CSS with Flexbox
- Index.html: create lessons and hyperlinks, use rest of HTML Tags
- Index.html: creating different lessons
- After H's explored, go back and adjust index.html
- Overwrite with vw units and demonstrate how these will change in a viewport

Understanding What the Semantic Tags are...
- Purpose: take how a blind person might use their imagination to "see" your website "knowing" where the Sematic Tags are located ...
- Purpose: take your content and place it in your Semantic Tags
- Develop your understanding of Semantic Tags and how these layout as divisions in your index.html & childTemplate.html pages

Try completing a To Do List, demonstrating how to do a To Do List

---

Laying out the DIVS Page
- Introduce HEAD-style to include wild card attribute being rewritten by inline style
- Demonstrate how different HTML-Tags can be styled on the whole webapge

---

Flexbox
- Extend HEAD-style wild card to style.css (verbalized, not taught until grade 11
- describe how .menu, .main, & .aside can be written into 

- .flexbox { **Copied code from each class** } //change one line instead of each copied-pasted line
- .menu { width:25% }
- .main { width:50% }

- Nav = menu + flexbox
- Main = main + flexbox
- Aside = menu + flexbox

- <del> [x] this is a crossed out item that looks odd </del>
- [x] <del> this is a crossed out item that looks better </del>
