- Index.html: create lessons and hyperlinks, use rest of HTML Tags
- Index.html: creating different lessons
- After H's explored, go back and adjust index.html
- Overwrite with vw units and demonstrate how these will change in a viewport

Understanding What the Semantic Tags are...
- Purpose: take how a blind person might use their imagination to "see" your website "knowing" where the Sematic Tags are located ...
- Purpose: take your content and place it in your Semantic Tags
- Develop your understanding of Semantic Tags and how these layout as divisions in your index.html & childTemplate.html pages
